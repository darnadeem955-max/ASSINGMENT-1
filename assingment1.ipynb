        "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is known for its readability and simplicity. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability using significant indentation. It's an interpreted language, which means it runs code directly line by line, making it fast for testing and prototyping. Python is also a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming. it is popular because it has unique features which includes.\n",
